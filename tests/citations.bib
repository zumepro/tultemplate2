	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors ({ICIs}) extend survival in many patients with cancer but are ineffective in patients without pre-existing immunity1-9. Although personalized {mRNA} cancer vaccines sensitize tumours to {ICIs} by directing immune attacks against preselected antigens, personalized vaccines are limited by complex and time-intensive manufacturing processes10-14. Here we show that {mRNA} vaccines targeting {SARS}-{CoV}-2 also sensitize tumours to {ICIs}. In preclinical models, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {mRNA} vaccines led to a substantial increase in type I interferon, enabling innate immune cells to prime {CD}8+ T cells that target tumour-associated antigens. Concomitant {ICI} treatment is required for maximal efficacy in immunologically cold tumours, which respond by increasing {PD}-L1 expression. Similar correlates of vaccination response are found in humans, including increases in type I interferon, myeloid-lymphoid activation in healthy volunteers and {PD}-L1 expression on tumours. Moreover, receipt of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {mRNA} vaccines within 100 days of initiating {ICI} is associated with significantly improved median and three-year overall survival in multiple large retrospective cohorts. This benefit is similar among patients with immunologically cold tumours. Together, these results demonstrate that clinically available {mRNA} vaccines targeting non-tumour-related antigens are potent immune modulators capable of sensitizing tumours to {ICIs}.},

	abstract = {To combat climate change, we must reduce carbon emissions from hyperscale cloud computing. Compute servers cause the majority of a general-purpose cloud’s emissions. Thus, we are motivated to design carbon-efficient compute server stock keeping units ({SKUs}), or {GreenSKUs}, using recently available low-carbon components. We built three {GreenSKU} prototypes, integrating energy-efficient {CPUs}, reusing old dynamic {RAM} via compute express link, and reusing old solid-state drives. We reveal challenges that limit {GreenSKUs}’ carbon savings at scale and may prevent their adoption by cloud providers. To address these challenges, we developed a novel framework, {GSF} ({GreenSKU} Framework), that enables cloud providers to systematically evaluate {GreenSKUs}’ carbon savings at scale. By implementing {GSF} within Microsoft Azure’s production constraints, we demonstrate that {GreenSKUs} reduce net cloud emissions by 8\%, which is globally significant. This work is the first to demonstrate and quantify how carbon-efficient server designs translate to measurable cloud-scale emissions reductions, enabling meaningful contributions to cloud sustainability goals.},

It covers everything you need to build and maintain larger code bases, write powerful and flexible applications and libraries, and confidently expand the scope and complexity of your projects. Author Jon Gjengset takes you deep into the Rust programming language, dissecting core topics like ownership, traits, concurrency, and unsafe code. You'll explore key concepts like type layout and trait coherence, delve into the inner workings of concurrent programming and asynchrony with async/await, and take a tour of the world of no\_std programming. Gjengset also provides expert guidance on {API} design, testing strategies, and error handling, and will help develop your understanding of foreign function interfaces, object safety, procedural macros, and much more."--Publisher website},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},
