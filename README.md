# tultemplate2

Easy Typst template for TUL documents. Begin by compiling `example.typ` and reading it.

## How to compile

It is recommended to use either:
- The on-line Typst editor (https://typst.app/play/) - use some zip build from releases
- The `typst` CLI tool (available in Arch repos and Snap)

On Linux, with the `typst` command available, you can just run:

```sh
make
```

That will compile the example document and view it.
